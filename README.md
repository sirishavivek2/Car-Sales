# Car-Sales
Visual Anlysis using SAS Studio
This Project Analyzes a Car Sales dataset Obtained from Kaggle, Which Provides extensive information on various car features to predict Car Sales. The Primary Objective is to identify the features that significantly impact Car Sales and to leverage these insights to build a predictive model. Using SAS Studio for Visual Analytics, this Project will Utilize advanced Analytical Techniques to understand relationships within the data and optimize the predictive capabilities of a classifier.

Project Plan
The Project is divided into two main tasks:
Feature Analysis: By Examining each feature in relationship to car sales, I will determine which factors hold the most predictive power for Sales Performance.
Model Training and Prediction: A Classifier will be trained using these impactful features to predict Car Sales outcomes. Model accuracy will be assessed to ensure its reliability for predictive Analysis.

Outcome Analyses
Sales Impact by Manufacture and Model:
Top Manufactures: The top three manufacturers are Dodge, Ford and Chevrolet contribute a large share of the sales. Analyzing the features common among high-selling models from these brands like pricing, horsepower or resale values could help pinpoint strategies these brand use to drive sales.
Model-wise Distribution: Specific models like the ford F-Series and Chevrolet Cavalier show high sales figures, potentially influenced by factors such as price, engine size and vehicle type.
Impact of Vehicle Type on Sales and Resale:
Passenger vs Car Segment: Passenger vehicles dominate sales at 74%, while cars make up, 26%. The higher percentage in passenger vehicles suggests a user preference for comfort, utility, or features offered by this segment. Analyzing the factors that might influence this preference such as fuel efficiency, engine size or width could provide insights.
Car Sales Trend by Vehicle Type: By Visualizing trends in sales for specific types of cars sedans, SUVâ€™s etc could forecast demand in certain Segments.
Feature Impact on Sales:
Engine Size and Horsepower: Vehicles with larger engines and higher horsepower such as Dodge Viper with 8L and 850 HP could be preferred for power but have niche sales due to price or fuel efficiency concerns, Evaluating the impact of horsepower and engine size on sales might reveal threshold where performance outweighs costs or fuel drawbacks.
Wheelbase and Width: As attribute tied to vehicle stability and passenger comfort, wheel base and width might influence sales positivity in higher-end, luxury models where comfort is prioritized.
Resale Value Predictors:
Resale by Model & Brand: Creating a model that uses  brand, vehicle type, price, and features as predictors can help determine which models are most likely to retain value. This can be especially useful for dealerships in marketing and sales pitches.
